# Math Dojo
JS program that writes both client-side and server-side Javascript. This program provides users with a platform to practice math problems. This is my
first experience with writing my own API with Node.js

# My Math API Documentation
The Math API provides randomly-generated
practice arithmetic problems and also computes
answers to problems given by the API user.

## Get randomly-generated practice arithmetic problem
**Request Format:** /practice

**Request Type:** GET

**Returned Data Format**: JSON

**Description:** Returns a JSON object containing
100 practice arithmetic problems

**Example Request:** /practice

**Example Response:**

```json
{
"0": "2 - 2"
"1": "1 + 1",
"2": "2 * 5 - 7 + 1,
...
"99": "5 * 5 - 5
}
```

**Error Handling:**
- N/A: It's not possible for the user to accidentally
send wrong parameters

## Get answer to arithmetic problem
**Request Format:** /solve/:expression

**Request Type:** GET

**Returned Data Format**: Plain Text

**Description:** Accepts a math arithmetic problem as
a route(required) parameter, then sends back the answer
to that arithmetic problem.

**Example Request:** /solve/2+2-2

**Example Response:**

```
"0"
```

**Error Handling:**
- Possible 400 (invalid request) errors (all plain text):
  - If passed in an invalid arithmetic problem, returns an error with the message: `Given problem {problem} is not a valid arithmetic problem!

<b>NOTE:</b> It isn't possible to send an incorrect math problem from within the Math Dojo program,
since all problems sent from Math Dojo were generated by my(this) API, and my API cannot generate
a problem in an incorrect format. This error handler is just here just in case this API
is accessed from outside the Math Dojo program.
