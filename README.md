# Math Dojo
This program is a platform for users to practice math problems. It provides randomly generated arithmetic problems, and 
also checks the user's answers to make sure they are correct(my API takes math problems as input, evaluates them, then sends back their answers). 

This JS program contains both client-side and server-side Javascript. This is my
first experience with writing my own API with Node.js

# My Math API Documentation
My Math API provides randomly generated
practice arithmetic problems and also computes
answers to problems given by the API user.

## Get randomly generated practice arithmetic problem
**Request Format:** /practice

**Request Type:** GET

**Returned Data Format**: JSON

**Description:** Returns a JSON object containing
100 randomly generated practice arithmetic problems

**Example Request:** /practice

**Example Response:**

```json
{
"0": "2 - 2"
"1": "1 + 1",
"2": "2 * 5 - 7 + 1,
...
"99": "5 * 5 - 5
}
```

**Error Handling:**
- N/A: It's not possible for the user to accidentally
send wrong parameters

## Get answer to arithmetic problem
**Request Format:** /solve/:expression

**Request Type:** GET

**Returned Data Format**: Plain Text

**Description:** Accepts a math arithmetic problem as
a route(required) parameter, then sends back the answer
to that arithmetic problem.

**Example Request:** /solve/2+2-2

**Example Response:**

```
"0"
```

**Error Handling:**
- Possible 400 (invalid request) errors (all plain text):
  - If passed in an invalid arithmetic problem, returns an error with the message: `Given problem {problem} is not a valid arithmetic problem!

<b>NOTE:</b> It isn't possible to send an incorrect math problem from within the Math Dojo program,
since all problems sent from Math Dojo were generated by my(this) API, and my API cannot generate
a problem in an incorrect format. This error handler is just here just in case this API
is accessed from outside the Math Dojo program.
